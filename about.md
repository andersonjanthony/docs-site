# About

## Authorship

The Security Benchmark for Salesforce (SBS) was originally authored by [Pablo Gonzalez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pablis/) during his work as Director of Research and Product Management at AutoRABIT. The benchmark emerged from his research into security posture management for Salesforce and systematic analysis of security requirements across enterprise deployments, distilling industry best practices into a formal compliance standard.

## Contributors

SBS has received contributions and review from Salesforce security practitioners, architects, and industry leaders who have helped refine and validate the controls within this benchmark. Contributors include practitioners from various Salesforce security tooling vendors, consulting firms, and enterprise organizations:

- **Pablo Gonzalez** — AutoRABIT 

*(Contributor list will be updated as the standard evolves through community feedback and peer review.)*

## Purpose and Independence

SBS is an **independent, community-driven security standard**. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Salesforce, Inc., or any specific vendor. While contributors include practitioners from Salesforce security tooling vendors, the benchmark itself is vendor-neutral and serves the broader Salesforce security community—including administrators, architects, auditors, consultants, and security tool vendors of all types.

The benchmark is published openly to enable:
- Objective security assessments by internal teams and external auditors
- Automated compliance scanning by security tooling vendors
- Consistent security expectations across organizations and consultancies
- Continuous improvement through community contributions and feedback

## Contributing

SBS is a living standard that will evolve as the Salesforce platform and security landscape change. Contributions, feedback, and suggestions from the community are welcome and encouraged.
