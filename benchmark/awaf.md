## Security Benchmark for Salesforce (SBS)

The **Security Benchmark for Salesforce (SBS)** defines a prescriptive set of technical and procedural controls designed to evaluate and improve the security posture of Salesforce organizations. The benchmark provides clear, measurable requirements that determine whether a Salesforce environment aligns with widely recognized security principles, including least privilege, secure configuration, controlled integration, and continuous monitoring.

SBS is developed by practitioners across the Salesforce and security ecosystems and is **not affiliated with or endorsed by Salesforce, Inc.** The benchmark is intended to serve as an independent, community-driven standard that helps organizations answer a fundamental question:  
**“Is my Salesforce org secure?”**

The controls in this benchmark are intentionally **prescriptive and binary**. Where defined requirements are not met, the organization should consider the environment noncompliant with the SBS standard and therefore at elevated risk.

SBS may be adopted voluntarily by organizations, auditors, consultants, security engineers, and SaaS vendors seeking a consistent, platform-specific yardstick for Salesforce security posture.
