## Security Benchmark for Salesforce (SBS)

The Security Benchmark for Salesforce (SBS) is a **formal security compliance standard** that defines mandatory, auditable requirements for securing Salesforce environments. Similar to the CIS Benchmarks for operating systems and cloud platforms, ISO 27001 controls, or NIST SP 800-53 security baselines, SBS provides prescriptive, platform-specific controls that establish what "secure" means for Salesforce implementations.

Unlike security guidance or best practices, SBS defines **binary compliance requirements** that organizations either meet or fail. Each control specifies an explicit requirement, audit procedure, and remediation path, enabling objective assessments by internal security teams, external auditors, and automated scanning tools.

SBS fills a critical gap in the Salesforce security ecosystem: while generic frameworks like NIST and ISO provide high-level principles, and Salesforce offers feature documentation, no independent, comprehensive security standard has existed specifically for Salesforce—until now. SBS serves as a practitioner-driven benchmark that unifies security expectations across administrators, architects, auditors, consultancies, and vendors.
